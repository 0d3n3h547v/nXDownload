# nXDownload
Download any file directly inside sdmc:/ on the Nintendo Switch
## NOTE:
This project uses my custom implementation of libcurl. You can use my own "customCurl.h" header, without problems! Be sure at least to credit!

- use command line "pacman -S switch-curl" inside Msys to compile this program.
## Features & ideas
- added possibility to read a custom url from sdmc:/switch/nXDownload/url.txt (still not working very well)
